This inspection searches for text which would be considered a list item if it were not preceded
by extra indentation spaces.

Some examples are list items following text:

```markdown
Paragraph text
    1. would be list item
```

This is also possible with a list item in an indented code block:

```markdown
    Indented code block
    1. would be list item
```
