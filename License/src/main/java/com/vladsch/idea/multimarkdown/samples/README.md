## Code Style Sample Files

:warning: For some reason syntax highlighting of [sample-fenced-code-document.md] is messed up
without space before info unless the info string is followed by a space. Possible cause is a bug
in the lexer which only shows up for code style sample view but not in real files.

Takeaway for now is to add a space after fenced code info string to make sure the display in
code styles is correct.
