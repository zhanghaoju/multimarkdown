Hi Ted,  

The only thing that I can see affecting formatting is the option for wrapping `Use character
font width` which queries the editor for actual character width and uses space for margin
computations. I am certain that if you disable this option then the effect will disappear.

How do you change the zoom level for text? Is it through the font size or is there another way
to zoom text in the IDE?

Best regards,

Vladimir.
